# Digital System Design Laboratory


This repository contains **10 projects in Verilog** that I completed during my Digital System Design lab course.
Each project has a corresponding report that describes its implementation. The project descriptions are available in the `report.pdf` file.

## Project Descriptions

1. **Project E1**: Examining the divisibility of numbers by 3 and 11
2. **Project E2**: Sequential circuits with schematic facilities
3. **Project E3**: Cascadable 1-bit comparator
4. **Project E4**: Stack
   - 4-bit stack with the capacity of 8 entries.
5. **Project E5**: Multiplier using Booth algorithm
6. **Project E6**: Incubator
7. **Project E7**: UART
8. **Project E8**: Complex number arithmetic in an ALU
9. **Project E9**: Tcam memory
10. **Project E10**: Simple processor
## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project folder you're interested in.
3. Read the project report to understand the implementation details.

Feel free to explore the code and learn from it! If you have any questions or need further clarification, don't hesitate to reach out.
