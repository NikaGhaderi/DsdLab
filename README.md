# Digital System Design Laboratory

This repository contains **10 projects in Verilog** that I completed during my Digital System Design lab course.
Each project has a corresponding report that describes its implementation. The project descriptions are available in the `report.pdf` file.

## Project Descriptions

1. **Project E1**: [Brief description of E1 project]
2. **Project E2**: [Brief description of E2 project]
3. **Project E3**: [Brief description of E3 project]
   - Pay special attention to the third project's README file.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project folder you're interested in.
3. Read the project report to understand the implementation details.

Feel free to explore the code and learn from it! If you have any questions or need further clarification, don't hesitate to reach out.
